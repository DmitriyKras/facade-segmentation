# Facade segmentation and windows counting
This repo is pet project in computer vision and semantic segmentation. The main aim is design or adaptate CNN to segment windows on different buildings and count them.
I used [CMP Facade Dataset](https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/) for this task. Dataset contains 606 images with corresponding masks.
